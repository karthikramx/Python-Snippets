# Built in functions vs Methods

# Methods, belongs / owned by some type. Like string have methods like (.join(),.format()). This belongs to the string class

# upper method

quote = "this is an amazing quote"
print(quote.upper()) # makes everything to upper
print(quote.capitalize()) # capitalizes the string

# the purple boxes! are methods for a certain data type
# remember that strings are immutable
# you can reassign to string but you cant edit it by indexing it!

# always recognize patterns!
