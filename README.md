### Objected Oriented Programming
#### The four pillars of object oriented programming
1. Encapsulation  --> The binding of functions and data into an object and the ability to modify the data associated with that object
2. Abstraction    --> Hiding of information, and giving access to only what the users need. (dont worry about implementation) camera.takepicture()
3. Inheritance    --> Enable one object to take on the properties of another object
4. Polymorphism   --> Ploy - many, morphism - forms
